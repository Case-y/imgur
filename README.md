Javascript workshop for Cal Hacks and Hackers @ Berkeley

[imgur-voice](https://carpetfizz.github.io/imgur-voice/) takes advantage of `webkitSpeechRecognition` in Google Chrome to search [imgur.com](http://imgur.com/)

I played around with gh-pages and wanted to try to make the imgur-voice files into my own single page.
